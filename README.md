Basic crud operations with json data, main focus is with tests. 

For future reference 

## Road Map
- Basic Crud on controllers (done)
- Tests (done)
- Service classess for controllers (done)
- Moar tests (started): (done)
- Spring Security (done)
- Testing with Spring Security (done)
- Testing with authenticated user / withDetails (done)
- Test wit anonymous user / with out details (done)
      just a few simple tests, spring security redirects to login on every request that is not authenticated

## Notes
- Jacoco plugin (run with: "mvn test jacoco:report")

## Other
So this one is pretty much done, and moving on to next one using Spring and Angular.
